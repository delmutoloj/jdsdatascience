# James Del Mutolo

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, my name is James Del Mutolo. I was born and raised in the Sunshine State and reside in Southwest Florida. Currently, I am a student at the University of South Florida majoring in Information Science with a concentration in Data Science and Analytics. My concentration was originally Information Security, but I found my passion for Data Science and Analytics while taking other required courses and changed my concentration soon after. I am slated to graduate with my Bachelor’s Degree in August 2025 with a 3.75 GPA.

# Areas of Interest and Topics Learned

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses that piqued my interest and prompted me to change my concentration of study to Data Science and Analytics were Data and Text Mining and Visual Analytics. Dr. Loni Hagen’s Data and Text Mining course had a major influence on my decision to change concentrations. The projects I completed in this course and others alike opened my eyes to how powerful information science and data analytics can be not only in driving the important decisions that large organizations make, but also in driving the decisions that I make in my process of understanding the data based concepts that I am passionate about. This, combined with the skills I’ve acquired in Dr. Alon Friedman’s Visual Analytics course, and other related courses, grew my passion for gathering and analyzing datasets and producing meaningful insights.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other courses that helped to build my foundational understanding of information science were Information Behaviors and Information Policy and Ethics. In Dr. Vanessa Reyes’ Information Behaviors course, I learned about the process of information seeking, and the patterns and processes that we follow in obtaining the information that we seek. This course also taught me about information literacy and the importance of being able to discern accurate, reliable information from inaccurate or deceptive information. Dr. Karen Kaufmann’s Information and Policy Ethics course grew my understanding of legislative tracing and policy analysis, and the ethical deliberation required in developing information policies. These policies and their frameworks will shape the decisions that I make as an information professional.

# Certifications, Awards, Certifications

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my senior year of high school, I obtained my CompTIA A+ certification, and completed the EMC Student Star Program. The Student Star Program is a four-day intensive workshop designed to equip students with the tools needed to excel in both their academic and professional journeys. EMC has since been acquired by Dell and is now known as Dell EMC.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found a passion for conducting research and formal writing while attending SCF for my Associates degree. In 2019, I was nominated by Dr. Marie Hendry for an Outstanding Student Essay in a Literature Course and accepted my award at the April 2019 SCF Honors Convocation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the skills that I have developed throughout the Information Science program, as well as through personal projects, include a strong foundational knowledge in R, using Python for application development as well as data analytics, some experience with SQL queries, and using Tableau to quickly create powerful visuals. More recently, I have started using GitHub to manage my projects which has taught me the importance of version control and the utility it provides.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the Information Science program, I have completed the following courses through DataCamp:

- Introduction to R
- Intermediate R
- Introduction to Data Visualization with ggplot2
- Intermediate Data Visualization with ggplot2
- Cluster Analysis in R
- Machine Learning with caret in R
- Introduction to Text Analysis in R
- Text Mining with Bag-of-Words in R

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interactive nature of the courses provided through DataCamp has helped me to learn these concepts in a thorough and efficient manner.

# Goals

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As information science is a constantly evolving field, I will continually embrace the process of lifelong learning. My goals currently include developing my interview skills and creating a career path for myself. For now, I would like to keep an open mind as to where exactly my career in information science will take me, as mentioned previously, it is a constantly evolving field and new doors are always opening. I feel that I would enjoy anything related to data analytics because I enjoy the process of extracting meaningful information from data, and using those insights to drive informed decisions, solve problems, and tell compelling stories through visualization and interpretation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will continue to develop my skills by taking courses through platforms such as DataCamp, and plan to earn related certifications such as the CompTIA Data+. I would also like to pursue a Masters of Science in Information Science, hopefully with the financial assistance of a future employer. Thank you for taking the time to read my enhanced biography.
