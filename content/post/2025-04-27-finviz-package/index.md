In this post, Iâ€™ll outline the different components of the finViz (Financial Visualization) package, walk you through how to use it, and share the process I followed to develop it.

# Functions

### statementCombine()

Body text

### financialSummary()

Body text

### financialSankey()

**Disclosure**: This function was created with significant help from ChatGPT. I will go over the specific prompts I used and offer my insight on using generative AI for coding later in this post.

``` r
# This is an R code chunk
library(finViz)
sankey <- financialSankey(deposits, spending)
```

    ## Links is a tbl_df. Converting to a plain data frame.

``` r
sankey
```
